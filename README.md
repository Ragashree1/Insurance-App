## About
The real estate application is a platform designed to facilitate seamless property transactions between sellers, buyers, and real estate agents. Sellers can work with property agents to list their properties with detailed descriptions, images, and pricing information. These listings are then made available to buyers, who can browse through the properties, shortlist their favorites, and schedule viewings or inquiries.
